📂 How It Works?

    Adding a Note:
        User types a note in the input field and clicks "Add Note".
        A new note is created dynamically using JavaScript and displayed on the screen.

    Editing a Note:
        Clicking on a note allows the user to edit its content in real time.
        Updates are reflected instantly in localStorage.

    Deleting a Note:
        Clicking the "Delete" button removes the note from the DOM and localStorage.
